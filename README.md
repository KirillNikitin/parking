During the day a parking lot registers each car’s arrival and leaving time with minute precision. That way an N amount of time pairs is created. The task is to find the timeframe where the parking lot was the busiest – had the most amount of cars at the same time. The time is registered so that if one car arrives at 11:10 and another one leaves at 11:10, then this mean there where 2 cars at the parking lot at 11:10

12:10, 18:00
14:00, 20:04
The file with time pairs might not be sorted.
